>[!NOTE]

## Updates in January 2023

+++**Maintenance Update on January 18, 2023**

**Expressions with wildcards are not valid in custom fields**

_Custom Forms_

When a user uses a wildcard such as \$$TODAY or $$NOW along with a modifier (such as "-30d") in a custom field, the validator does not accept the wildcard as valid. Wildcards without modifiers are seen as valid.

**[!UICONTROL Workload Balancer] shows hours not associated with a project/task/issue**

_[!UICONTROL Workload Balancer]_

When a user views the [!UICONTROL Workload Balancer], they see hours logged for a user that are not associated with any project, task, or issue, nor are they logged as [!UICONTROL General] hours. These hours may display only in the 4 Week or 6 Week view.

+++**[!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion] Maintenance Update (Hot Fix) on January 12, 2023**

**404 errors on [!DNL Workfront] modules**

_Workfront Fusion_

When a scenario runs, a [!DNL Workfront] module returns a 404 error.

This has been reported in the following modules:

* [!UICONTROL Read a record]

+++

+++**Maintenance Update (Hot Fix) on January 12, 2023**

**"[!UICONTROL Whoops]" error when setting up a calculated field**

_Custom Forms_

When a user is creating or editing a calculated field on a custom form, and includes a custom field in the calculated field's expression, the expression is considered invalid. The [!UICONTROL Save] button is disabled, and the user cannot navigate away from the custom field. In addition, the user sees the following message below the field:

"[!UICONTROL Whoops! Something went wrong. Please contact Workfront so we can figure out what went wrong and fix it.]"

Removing the custom field from the expression allows the user to save and navigate away from the field.

**Cannot set access levels**

_Users_

When a user attempts to change the access level of another user, the access levels are grayed out and the user cannot change them. This occurs even when the user attempting the change is a system administrator.

+++

+++**Maintenance Update on January 12, 2023**

**Ctrl+F or Cmd+F does not work as expected in dropdown fields**

_Custom Forms_

When a user is filling out a custom form and searches a dropdown list using Ctrl+F or Cmd+F, then attempts to jump to the next instance of that search, the dropdown list returns to the top of the list rather than jumping to the next instance of the search. This occurs when a dropdown is set to allow multiple selections.

**[!UICONTROL Edit Report] screen is blank**

_Reports_

When a user is viewing a report and attempts to edit the report, the user is taken to a blank screen and cannot edit the report.

**Indented tasks do not remain indented**

_Tasks_

When a user is viewing a task list and indents a task, the task immediately returns to its original (outdented) state.

+++

+++**Maintenance Update on January 5, 2023**

**Pin functionality available in [!UICONTROL More] menu**

_Navigation_

The following features are now available in the [!UICONTROL More] menu for pins, in the Preview environment only:

* Renaming pins
* Reordering pins within the [!UICONTROL More] menu
* Moving a pin out of the [!UICONTROL More] menu (when you do this, the last pin in the top navigation bar is moved to the [!UICONTROL More] menu)

**Removed the project Group limitation from adding users to the project team**

_Teams_

We have removed the limitation that required that the users that need to be added to a project team must be in the Group associated with the project. Now, you can add any active user to a project team, regardless of what groups they belong to.

**New information icons for timesheets, timesheet profiles, and timesheet preferences**

>[!NOTE]
>
>This update has been released to the Preview environment on November 3, 2022 and it is now available in Production

_Workfront_

We have added several information icons to the following settings:  

* "Can edit time" checkbox when creating or editing a timesheet or a timesheet profile to indicate that when enabled, approvers can also submit, reopen, or edit the timesheet, unless your administrator restricts these actions in the Timesheet Preferences area of Setup. 
* "Restrict timesheet editing to owners and admins" in the Timesheet & Hour Preferences area of Setup to indicate that when disabled, the following users can also edit the timesheets: users with administrative access to timesheets and hours, timesheet approvers allowed to edit time, and timesheet owners' managers. 

Notice that the functionality of these settings has not changed and only the information icons have been added to add clarity to the scope of the settings.
