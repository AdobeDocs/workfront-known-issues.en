## Updates in June 2022

These issues were fixed only in the new Workfront experience. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported.

+++**Maintenance Update on June 9, 2022**

The following customer-reported issues were fixed on June 9, 2022.

**Cannot select objects to filter in Portfolio Optimizer preferences**

*Portfolios*

When a user is in the Portfolio Optimizer and views the Project Filters tab in the Preferences area, the checkboxes next to the objects are absent. The user cannot check or uncheck boxes, and therefore cannot select objects to filter.

**Cannot change Planned Start or Completion Dates when "Schedule From" is not checked**

*Projects*

When a user attempts to edit the Planned Start Date or Planned Completion Date of a project, and the "Schedule From" option for that project is not checked, the Planned Start Date and Planned Completion Date areas are disabled, and the user cannot edit those dates.

**Cannot edit access level of users**

*Users*

When a user who has Planner access that includes User Admin (Group Users) access attempts to edit users in the group they are an admin for, the Access level field is disables, and the user is unable to edit the access level.

+++

+++**Workfront Scenario Planner Maintenance Update on June 9, 2022**

**Resizable left panel in the Scenario Planner**

*Workfront Scenario Planner*

You can now resize the left panel on a Plan, in the Scenario Planner. This allows longer initiative names to display fully. Prior to this update, longer initiative names were truncated. 

+++

+++**Workfront Fusion Maintenance Update on June 9, 2022**

**Data from custom forms not available in Workfront Fusion Workfront modules**

_Workfront Fusion_

When a user is configuring a Workfront module in Workfront Fusion, and attempts to select outputs for the module, fields from custom forms are not visible. This occurs when the custom form was created for one type of Workfront object and then another type was added to it. Workfront Fusion displays only fields from custom forms originally created for the selected object type.

**Cannot scroll to view all scenario executions**

_Workfront Fusion_

When a user is viewing a scenario's execution history and attempts to scroll down to view more executions, the executions stop loading and the user is unable to view them. Additionally, the user cannot scroll back up to the most recent executions.

+++

+++**Maintenance Update on June 2, 2022**

**Portfolio Optimizer shows a score of 0 when using language other than English**

_Portfolios_

When a user is using Workfront in a language other than English and views the Portfolio Optimizer, the score displays as 0. This may occur even when the business case is not complete.

**Calculated field values incorrect when creating project from template**

_Projects_

When a user is creating a project from a template that includes calculated fields, the field values that appear on the new project are incorrect. 

**Cannot edit Conditions in Project Preferences are of Setup**

_Setup_

When a user attempts to edit Conditions in the Project Preferences area of Setup, the page is blank.

**New limitation to the number of characters in an update in Preview** 

_Workload Balancer_

>[!NOTE]
>
>This update applies only to the Review environment.

To improve the performance of the Updates area, we have introduced a  new limit to the number of characters that you can enter in an update or a reply to an existing update. The new limit is 15,000 characters. This update did not change the number of characters allowed when using the API. The API character limit for updates is 4,000. Updates
Support for Typehead type custom fields in Workload Balancer filters 

We are now supporting filters based on the Typeahead type custom fields in the Workload Balancer. Prior to this patch, filtering for this type of custom fields was not possible in the Workload Balancer.

**Cannot edit permissions on a user's role**

_Workfront Proof_

When a user attempts to edit the "Resolve comments and apply actions" or "Share a proof by tagging" permissions on a user's role in Workfront Proof, the changes are not saved. The user gets a notification that the template has been updated, but if the user opens the role permissions again they can see that the changes were not saved.
