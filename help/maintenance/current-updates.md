#### Boards

**Issues when viewing subtask status**

The following issues have been reported regarding viewing subtask status on a card in Boards:

* The status is shown as "Select status" even when the task already has a status. This status can be seen when viewing the task directly.
* If the user attempts to select a status, the screen goes blank and must be refreshed.

**Card doesn't close when using Boards view in a Project**

When a user is viewing the Boards view on a task list in a project, and creates a card, the card does not close or save. This prevents the user from returning to the project.

To close the card, the user must edit the URL to remove "board" and anything to the right of "board."

### Maintenance Update on January 11, 2023

#### Boards

**Completed cards not loading properly on dynamic boards**

Previously, the only way to include completed work on a dynamic board was to load the cards as archived cards. Otherwise, completed cards were not loaded on the board at all. This caused issues with being able to locate cards.

Now, when creating a dynamic board, completed cards are loaded by default as archived cards, but you can select Do not archive completed cards to load all completed cards on the board as visible cards in the Completed column.
