## Updates in January 2023

+++**Maintenance Update on January 5, 2023**

**Pin functionality available in [!UICONTROL More] menu**

_Navigation_

The following features are now available in the [!UICONTROL More] menu for pins, in the Preview environment only:

* Renaming pins
* Reordering pins within the [!UICONTROL More] menu
* Moving a pin out of the [!UICONTROL More] menu (when you do this, the last pin in the top navigation bar is moved to the [!UICONTROL More] menu)

**Removed the project Group limitation from adding users to the project team**

_Teams_

We have removed the limitation that required that the users that need to be added to a project team must be in the Group associated with the project. Now, you can add any active user to a project team, regardless of what groups they belong to.

**New information icons for timesheets, timesheet profiles, and timesheet preferences**

>[!NOTE]

>This update has been released to the Preview environment on November 3, 2022 and it is now available in Production

_Workfront_

We have added several information icons to the following settings:  

* "Can edit time" checkbox when creating or editing a timesheet or a timesheet profile to indicate that when enabled, approvers can also submit, reopen, or edit the timesheet, unless your administrator restricts these actions in the Timesheet Preferences area of Setup. 
* "Restrict timesheet editing to owners and admins" in the Timesheet & Hour Preferences area of Setup to indicate that when disabled, the following users can also edit the timesheets: users with administrative access to timesheets and hours, timesheet approvers allowed to edit time, and timesheet owners' managers. 

Notice that the functionality of these settings has not changed and only the information icons have been added to add clarity to the scope of the settings.
