The following maintenance updates have been made in 2022:

## Updates in June 2022

These issues were fixed only in the new Workfront experience. Adobe Workfront Classic is no longer supported. 

All Workfront Classic functionality will be removed in July 2022. Please transition to the new experience as soon as possible.

+++**Maintenance Update on June 9, 2022**

The following customer-reported issues were fixed on June 9, 2022.

*This update also includes other minor or less prominent bug fixes. Workfront Support will notify you when an issue you submitted is fixed.

**Cannot select objects to filter in Portfolio Optimizer preferences**

*Portfolios*

When a user is in the Portfolio Optimizer and views the Project Filters tab in the Preferences area, the checkboxes next to the objects are absent. The user cannot check or uncheck boxes, and therefore cannot select objects to filter.

**Cannot change Planned Start or Completion Dates when "Schedule From" is not checked**

*Projects*

When a user attempts to edit the Planned Start Date or Planned Completion Date of a project, and the "Schedule From" option for that project is not checked, the Planned Start Date and Planned Completion Date areas are disabled, and the user cannot edit those dates.

**Cannot edit access level of users**

*Users*

When a user who has Planner access that includes User Admin (Group Users) access attempts to edit users in the group they are an admin for, the Access level field is disables, and the user is unable to edit the access level.
