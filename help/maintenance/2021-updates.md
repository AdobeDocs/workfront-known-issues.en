<https://one.workfront.com/s/article/Workfront-Maintenance-Updates-1882317350>

The following maintenance updates were made in 2021:

## Updates in December 2021

+++**Maintenance Update on December 23, 2021**

**New tasks default to incorrect task constraint**

_Tasks_

When a user creates a new task using the "New Task" button, and the New Task Default Start Date option is set to "Today," the task constraint of the created task is set to "As soon as possible" rather than "Start no earlier than." This can also occur when using project templates

**Opening schedule in Groups area leads to blank page**

_Setup_

When a user is viewing groups in the Setup area and attempts to open, edit, or copy a schedule, the schedule does not open and the user sees a blank page.

**Changes do not display when reordering left navigation**

_Navigation_

When a user attempts to reorder the left navigation panel by dragging an item, the item appears back in its previous place when the user drops it. If the user refreshes the page, the left panel displays the new order.

**Link to submit a requested document leads to blank page.**

_Documents_

When a user receives a request to submit a document, and clicks on the link to the object where the document was requested, the link leads to a blank page. This may occur when clicking a link in an email or in an in-app notification.

**Workload Balancer shows 0 hours allocated**

_Workload Balancer_

When a user is viewing the Workload Balancer and has the "Show projected dates" setting enabled, any dates in the future display 0 hours allocated.

**Proofs intermittently disappear from folders**

_Workfront Proof_

When a user who is logged into Workfront Proof views a folder, the folder appears empty. If the user checks back later, the proofs are visible.

+++**Maintenance Update on December 16, 2021**

**Clicking announcement in notifications list leads to blank page**

_Notifications_

When a user opens their list of notifications from the notifications icon, then clicks on an announcement, they are taken to a blank page, and the announcement does not display.

**Summary panel shows "No selection" when task is selected**

Tasks

When a user opens a document summary in the documents area of a project, then goes to the task list, selects a task, and attempts to open the task summary, the task summary does not display, and the user sees the following message:

No selection. Select a document in the list to view details.

The message mentions documents even though the user is in the task list.

**Unassigned Work does not load**

_Workload Balancer_

When a user in the Workload Balancer creates a filter using the Assignment:Role ID field, the Unassigned Work area does not load. 

**Attaching template using "Customize and attach" option clears custom field values**

_Projects_

If a user attaches a template to a project using the "Customize and attach" option, and the project has a custom form attached to it already, the custom field values do not carry over and must be manually re-entered. This occurs even when the template includes the same custom form.
