# Proofs: Cannot create a new version of a proof

When a user attempts to create a new version of a proof, the new proof is not generated, and the user sees the following message:

```
Error
Error generating proof
```

**Workaround**: 

Create a new proof (not a new version of a proof) with the file that would be the new version, and make a comment on the old version linking to the new proof.
