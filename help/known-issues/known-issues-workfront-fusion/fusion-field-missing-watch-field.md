# Workfront Fusion: Field is missing from module

When a user is configuring a module in Workfront Fusion, they may notice that a field is missing from the available options. This may occur when a user updates their custom fields, and has used the scenario designer within the last hour.

This has been reported in the Workfront > Watch fields module.

**Workaround**

This issue is due to caching in Workfront Fusion. Because the cache is refreshed every hour, wait an hour and then try again.
