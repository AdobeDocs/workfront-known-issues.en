# Fusion in-app help links do not lead to specific help pages

Help links in Workfront Fusion do not currently lead to the intented help pages. Instead, all Fusion help links lead to the Workfront Documentation Home page. From this landing page, you can search for the information you need.

**Workaround**

When the help link takes you to the Workfront Documentation Home page, search using the Search icon at the upper-right of the screen.
