When a [!DNL Workfront Fusion] module returns a 404 error, the error does not give any further details about what caused the error. This is because the 404 error is sent to [!DNL Workfront Fusion] from the application that the module is connecting to, and that application has not provided additional details to [!DNL Workfront Fusion].

This is an issue with the application Fusion is trying to connect to, and must be resolved in that application.
