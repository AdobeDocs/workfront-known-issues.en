# Workfront Fusion: Fusion module returns 404 error with no further information

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue has been closed because it is not a Workfront Fusion issue.

When a Workfront Fusion module returns a 404 error, the error does not give any further details about what caused the error. This is because the 404 error is sent to Workfront Fusion from the application that the module is connecting to, and that application has not provided additional details to Workfront Fusion.

_First reported on August 9, 2022._
