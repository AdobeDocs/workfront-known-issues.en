When a user is viewing a scenario execution history and attempts to see more detail about an error by clicking on the error, the details do not open and the user sees the following message:

"[!UICONTROL The execution cannot be displayed: Cannot initialize the scenario because of the reason 'ENOENT: no such file or directory'.]"

**Workaround**

Click "[!UICONTROL Go to original record]" and view the error there.
