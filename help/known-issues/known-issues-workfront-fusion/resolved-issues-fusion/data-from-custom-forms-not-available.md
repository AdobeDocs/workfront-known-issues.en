# Workfront Fusion: Data from custom forms not available in Workfront Fusion Workfront modules

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on June 9, 2022.

When a user is configuring a Workfront module in Workfront Fusion, and attempts to select outputs for the module, fields from custom forms are not visible. This occurs when the custom form was created for one type of Workfront object and then another type was added to it. Workfront Fusion displays only fields from custom forms originally created for the selected object type.

First reported on April 24, 2022.
