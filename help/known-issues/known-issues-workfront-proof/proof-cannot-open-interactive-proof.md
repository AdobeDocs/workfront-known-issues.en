# [!DNL Workfront Proof]: Cannot open an interactive proof

When a user attempts to open an interactive proof, the proof does not open and the user sees the following message:

"[!UICONTROL Proof not loaded (501) Try again]"

This occurs after the user has updated their version of [!DNL Workfront Proof].
