# [!DNL Workfront Proof]: Proof does not load when using "[!UICONTROL Go to proof]" button in email notification

When a user attempts to go to a proof using the "[!UICONTROL Go to proof]" button in an email notification, the user is taken to a blank, gray page. The proof does not load.

**Workaround:**

Access the proof in [!DNL Workfront Proof] directly.
