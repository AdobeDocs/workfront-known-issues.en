# Proofs: Inaccurate proof approval deadline displayed in Home Work List

When a user is assigned to a proof approval, that proof approval displays in the user's Home Work List with the deadline of the stage that is farthest in the future, regardless of which stage that user is assigned to. 

In other words, all approvers on all stages of a given proof see the same deadline in their Home Work List. That deadline is the deadline of the stage that is furthest in the future.
