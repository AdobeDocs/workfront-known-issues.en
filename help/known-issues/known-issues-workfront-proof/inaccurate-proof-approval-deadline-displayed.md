When a user is assigned to a proof approval, that proof approval displays in the user's [!UICONTROL Home Work List] with the deadline of the stage that is farthest in the future, regardless of which stage that user is assigned to. 

In other words, all approvers on all stages of a given proof see the same deadline in their [!UICONTROL Home Work List]. That deadline is the deadline of the stage that is furthest in the future.
