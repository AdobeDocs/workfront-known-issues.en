# Workfront Proof: User options cannot be modified after initial configuration in Workflow Templates

When a user is adding a user to a Workflow Template, they can configure options. However, after the initial configuration is complete, the user can no longer modify the following:

* "Resolve comments and apply actions" ability
* "Share proof by tagging" ability
* Proof role (Reviewer, Approver, etc.)
