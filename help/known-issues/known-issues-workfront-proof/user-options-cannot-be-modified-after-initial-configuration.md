When a user is adding a user to a [!UICONTROL Workflow Template], they can configure options. However, after the initial configuration is complete, the user can no longer modify the following:

* "[!UICONTROL Resolve comments and apply actions]" ability
* "[!UICONTROL Share proof by tagging]" ability
* Proof role ([!UICONTROL Reviewer], [!UICONTROL Approver], etc.)
