# Proofs: Text options box shows "textAnnotations"

<!--This article is on the WF and WFP TOCs-->

When a user is viewing a proof, begins to add a comment, and opens the Text tool, the word "textAnnotation" appears next to the options in the tool. The Text tool still functions as expected, and "textAnnotation" disappears after the comment is posted.
