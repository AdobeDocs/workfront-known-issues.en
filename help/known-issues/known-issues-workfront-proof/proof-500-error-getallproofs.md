<!--This article is on Proof and Fusion TOCs-->

When a user accesses the [!DNL Workfront Proof] API [!UICONTROL `getAllProofs`] action, the server returns the following message:

[!UICONTROL 500 Internal Server Error]

Because [!DNL Workfront Fusion] uses the [!DNL Workfront Proof] API for [!DNL Workfront Proof] modules, this error may be returned to a module, halting a scenario.
