# Workload Balancer: User displays as overallocated because of inaccurate capacity

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on November 2, 2023.

A user may show in the Workload Balancer as overallocated. If a user hovers over the overallocation, they see that the user's capacity is set to 0.

If the user changes the date range, the allocation is accurate. However, if the user refreshes the page, the capacity may be inaccurate again.
