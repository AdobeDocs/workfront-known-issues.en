# Boards: Card doesn't close when using Boards view in a Project

When a user is viewing the Boards view on a task list in a project, and creates a card, the card does not close or save. This prevents the user from returning to the project.

To close the card, the user must edit the URL to remove "board" and anything to the right of "board."
