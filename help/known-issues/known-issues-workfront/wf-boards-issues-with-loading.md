# Boards: Issues when loading a board

When a user attempts to load a board, one of the following may occur:

* The board loads extremely slowly
* The board does not load, and the user sees the error "[!UICONTROL Something went wrong while loading this board. Refresh the page to try again, or contact support with the error ID below if the problem persists.]"

This issue appears to be limited to boards that are in Workstreams.
