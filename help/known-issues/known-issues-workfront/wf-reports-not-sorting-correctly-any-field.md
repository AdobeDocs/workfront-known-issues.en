>This issue has been closed because it is not an issue.

When a user runs a task report, the report appears to sort correctly when it is loading, but when it finishes loading the user sees that the report is not sorted correctly. 

This sorting issue is not limited to any particular type of field.

**Workaround**

View and sort the report in a dashboard.
