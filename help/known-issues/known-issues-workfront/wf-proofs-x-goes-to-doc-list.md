# Proofs: Closing proof redirects to documents list

When a user is viewing a proof and clicks the X icon to close it, the user is redirected to the documents list instead of the document details.

This occurs when both of the following are true:

* The user has opened the proof from a link. If the proof is opened from the document details, the user is directed back to the document details when closing the proof.
* The user belongs to an organization that has not yet been migrated to the Adobe Unified Shell.
