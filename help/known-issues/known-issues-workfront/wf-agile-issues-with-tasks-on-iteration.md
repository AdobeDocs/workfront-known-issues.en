>This issue was fixed on November 4, 2022.

The following issues have been reported regarding issues added to an iteration:

* Some subtasks of a task added to an iteration do not appear on the [!UICONTROL Iteration] page. 
* When a user attempts to add a missing task to the iteration, the task is not added and the user sees the following message:
  
  "[!UICONTROL The following error occurred: None of the selected items could be moved, because they are not assigned to an agile team or are not agile items]"
