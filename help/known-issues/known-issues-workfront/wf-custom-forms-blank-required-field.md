# Custom forms: "Invalid fields" message when editing a custom form

When a user is editing custom forms in the Details area of an object, and one of the custom forms has a required field that is currently blank, The user cannot edit forms, and sees the following message:

"There are invalid fields on this page. Enter valid field values before submitting your changes."

This may occur even though the edits are on a different custom form than the form with the blank required field.

**Workaround**

Open only the forms that will be edited. Leave the form with the blank required field closed while editing the other forms.
