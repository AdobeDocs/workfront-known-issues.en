# Integrations: Filename is "null" when sent to AEM via integration

When a large file (over 100 MB) is sent to Adobe Experience Manager via the Workfront integration, the filename in AEM is "null." 

This has been reported with both ZIP and TIF files.

**Workaround**

Do one of the following:

* Map the document name to the AEM title.
* Enter the filename directly in AEM.
