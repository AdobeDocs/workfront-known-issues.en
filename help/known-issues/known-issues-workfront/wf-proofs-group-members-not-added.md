# Proofs: Adding a group to a proof does not add all members of the group

<!--This issue is on the WF and WFP TOCs-->

When a user is creating a proof and uses a group to add users to a stage, not all the users of that group are added to the stage.

**Workaround**

Each user can be individually added to the stage.
