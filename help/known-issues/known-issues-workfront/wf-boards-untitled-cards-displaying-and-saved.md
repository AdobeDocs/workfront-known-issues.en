# Boards: Untitled cards display and appear in backlog

When a user attempts to open a card, the card displays with the name "Untitled" and blank fields. After a time, the desired card details may populate, or the card may remain blank.

In addition, these untitled cards may save to the board's backlog, causing confusion.

**Workaround**

If the card details do not display, close the card and open it again.
