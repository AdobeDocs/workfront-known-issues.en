# Boards: Checklist totals are not accurate

When a user is viewing a card that has checklist items, and makes a change such that the checklist total should change, the total does not change.

This has been reported both in the [!UICONTROL Boards] area and the [!UICONTROL Boards] widget in the new [!UICONTROL Home] experience.
