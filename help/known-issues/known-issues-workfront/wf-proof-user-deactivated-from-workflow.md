# Proofs: User is deactivated from proof workflow and gets "[!UICONTROL Access not permitted]" when accessing proof

<!--This is on both the WF and WFP TOCs-->

When a user attempts to access a proof they they are assigned to a workflow on, they see the following message:

"[!UICONTROL Access not permitted. You do not have the correct permissions to view this page Please contact your administrator for details.]"

This occurs because the user has been automatically deactivated on the proof workflow. 

**Workaround**

Reactivating the user will temporarily allow access.
