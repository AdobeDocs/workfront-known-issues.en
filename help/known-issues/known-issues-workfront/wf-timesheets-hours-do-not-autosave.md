description: When a user enters hours into a timesheet, scrolls the timesheet so that the entered hours are not visible, and clicks into another box to add hours, the autosave function does not trigger, and the hours are not saved. This occurs even though total hours at the right of the screen appear accurate. If the user refreshes, the hours on the right will show that the hours were not saved.

>This issue was fixed on July 29, 2022.

When a user enters hours into a timesheet, scrolls the timesheet so that the entered hours are not visible, and clicks into another box to add hours, the autosave function does not trigger, and the hours are not saved. This occurs even though total hours at the right of the screen appear accurate. If the user refreshes, the hours on the right will show that the hours were not saved.
