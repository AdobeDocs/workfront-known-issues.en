# [!UICONTROL Workload Balancer]: Hours do not adjust to account for user time off

If a user schedules time off and has tasks assigned, the Workload Balancer does not update the timeline to account for the time off. Instead, the [!UICONTROL Workload Balancer] shows that the user is overallocated for the days they have scheduled off. To adjust hours, the admin must go into the project and recalculate the timeline.
