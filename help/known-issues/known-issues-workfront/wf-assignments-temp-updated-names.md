# Assignments fields: Temporarily updated names for the user- and role- assignment fields

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was resolved on September 8, 2022.

On September 1, a temporary name change for two [!DNL Workfront] assignment fields was introduced into Production:

* **[!UICONTROL Assignment Users]** is temporarily **[!UICONTROL Assigned Users]**.
* **[!UICONTROL Assignment Roles]** is temporarily **[!UICONTROL Assigned Roles]**.

Both fields will be reverted back to their original labels in Production next week.

A temporary note has been added to the [Glossary of [!DNL Adobe Workfront] terminology](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/basics/workfront-terminology-glossary.html).
