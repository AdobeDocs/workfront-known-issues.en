# Projects: Project is blank when loaded from new [!UICONTROL Home] experience

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on September 7, 2023.

When a user clicks on a project from their [!UICONTROL Home] page in the new Home experience, the project's page fails to load.

This occurs when the user has logged in as another user, then logged out as the other user and returned to their own [!UICONTROL Home] page.

**Workaround**

Reload the page.
