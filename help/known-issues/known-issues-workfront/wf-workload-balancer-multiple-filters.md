# Workload Balancer: Inaccurate results when using multiple filters at once

When a user is viewing the Workload Balancer and uses multiple filters at the same time, results are not accurate. For example, a result that displays when using Filter A and when using Filter B does not display when using both Filter A and B at the same time.

**Workaround**

You can combine both filters into one new filter.
