# Workload Balancer: Inaccurate results when using multiple filters at once

>[!NOTE]

>This issue has been closed because it is not an issue.

When a user is viewing the Workload Balancer in the Resource Management area, and uses multiple filters at the same time, results are not accurate. For example, a result that displays when using Filter A and when using Filter B does not display when using both Filter A and B at the same time.

**Workaround**

You can combine both filters into one new filter.
