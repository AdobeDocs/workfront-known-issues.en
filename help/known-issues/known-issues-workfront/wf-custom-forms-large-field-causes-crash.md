# Custom forms: Cannot edit fields on field list page

When a user attempts to adit a large field on the field list page, the page crashes with the following error:

"[!UICONTROL Aww Snap, something went wrong displaying this page. Error code 5]"

This has been reported with Chromium-based browsers

**Workaround**

Try one of the following:

* Edit the field directly in the form
* Use a different browser, such as Firefox or Safari
