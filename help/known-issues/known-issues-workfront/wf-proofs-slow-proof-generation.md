When a user attempts to add a proof to a Workfront work item through the [!UICONTROL Add new] > [!UICONTROL Proof] option, using an automated workflow, the proof takes several minutes to generate.

**Workaround**

Add the document you want to create a proof of as a document, then generate the proof from the document.
