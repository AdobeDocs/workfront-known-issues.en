When a user attempts to log hours on a task in their timesheet, the hours are not saved, and the user sees the following messages:

* Message at bottom of screen: "[!UICONTROL Your recent changes were not saved. Refresh the page to view the last saved changes.]"
* Pop-up message in upper-right corner: "[!UICONTROL Cannot invoke "java.util.List.stream()" because "hourList" is null]"
