# Updates: Copied link does not paste correctly

If a user copies a link from an update by right-clicking and selecting "[!UICONTROL Copy link address]", then pastes the link in an update, the link does not paste correctly. Only the first part of the link is a link, and the rest of the URL is ignored.

Copying the link using a method other "[!UICONTROL Copy link address]" allows the link to paste as expected.

**Workaround**

Use the "[!UICONTROL Copy]" option instead of "[!UICONTROL Copy link address]".
