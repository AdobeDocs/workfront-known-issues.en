# Proofs: Breadcrumb missing when accessing proof from email link

When a user views a proof by clicking on the Go To Proof button in a proof notification email, the breadcrumb link to the proof's parent object is missing.

**Workaround**

View the proof from within Workfront instead of through the proof notification email.
