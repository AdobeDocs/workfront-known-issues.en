# Reports: Hour report filters include incorrect dates

When filtering an hour report to show only a specific date, a different adjacent date is actually included in the report. This issue appears to be related to timezone settings.

**Workaround**

By using text mode to specify the date in the filter, the correct date is included in the report.
