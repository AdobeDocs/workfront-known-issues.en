# Tasks: Cannot add subtask

When a user attempts to add a subtask using the "[!UICONTROL +New]" button, no options appear in the [!UICONTROL New Task] window, and the user sees the following message:

"[!UICONTROL Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'validations)]"

**Workaround**

Do one of the following:

* Click the "[!UICONTROL More options]" button under the error message in the [!UICONTROL New Task] window.
* Add the new subtask inline on the list of subtasks in the [!UICONTROL Subtasks] area of the task.
