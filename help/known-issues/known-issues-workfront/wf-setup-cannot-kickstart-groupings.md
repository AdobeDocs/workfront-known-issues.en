When a user attempts to [!UICONTROL Kick-Start] a grouping, the import is unsuccessful, and the user sees an error message similar to one of the following:

* [!UICONTROL The following error occurred: The supplied data appears to be in the Office 2007+ XML. You are calling the part of POI that deals with OLE2 Office Documents. You need to call a different part of POI to process this data (eg XSSF instead of HSSF)]
* [!UICONTROL Whoops! Something went wrong. Preference file not found. Preference Key: temp row: 3 sheet: UIGB]

This may occur even though filters and views are successfully [!UICONTROL Kick-Started].
