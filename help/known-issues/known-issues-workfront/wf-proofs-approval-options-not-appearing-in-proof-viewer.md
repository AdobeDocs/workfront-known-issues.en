# Proofs: Approval options do not appear in [!UICONTROL Proofing Viewer]

When a user attempts to approve a proof in the [!UICONTROL Desktop Proofing Viewer], soon after the approval was requested, the approval options are not visible, and the user cannot approve the proof. The approval options appear several hours after the approval was requested.

**Workaround**

Approve the document from the [!UICONTROL Document Details] page in [!DNL Workfront].
