# Approvals: Approval decision buttons not displaying in Proof Viewer for Teams

When an approver is viewing a proof in the Proof Viewer and attempts to make a decision, the decision buttons are not available.

This issue applies to users whose team has been added as an approver, and not to users who were added individually.

**Workaround**

Approve the proof in the Document Summary or Document Details page in Workfront.
