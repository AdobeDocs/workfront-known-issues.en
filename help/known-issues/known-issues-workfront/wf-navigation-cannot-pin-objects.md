# Navigation: Cannot pin objects

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on November 16, 2022.

When a user attempts to pin an object in [!DNL Workfront], the object is not pinned, and the user sees the following message:

"[!UICONTROL Something went wrong while pinning. Please contact [!DNL Workfront] so we can fix this.]"

This can occur when pinning an object even if the user can successfully pin lists.
