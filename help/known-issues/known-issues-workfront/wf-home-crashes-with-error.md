# Home: Home crashes with "Out of memory" error

When a user attempts to view the new Home, the site crashes with the following error message:

"Something went wrong while presenting this page! Error code: Out of memory"

**Workaround**

This may be caused by too many items in a widget. We recommend the following:

* Filtering so that fewer items are included in the widget
* Removing the widget from Home
