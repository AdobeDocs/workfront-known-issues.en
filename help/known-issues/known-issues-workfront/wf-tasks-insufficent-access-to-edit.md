# Tasks: "Insufficient access" message when inline editing tasks

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on November 21, 2025.

When a user attempts to inline edit a task in a list or report, they cannot edit the task, and they see the message "You do not have sufficient access to make assignments to this task."

This occurs when the user has inherited permissions on the task and the Make assignments option is disabled via project sharing.

**Workaround**

Open the task and edit it directly.
