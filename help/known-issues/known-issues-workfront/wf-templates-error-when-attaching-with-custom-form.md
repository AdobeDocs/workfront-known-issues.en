# Templates: Error when attaching template to project

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was fixed on January 18, 2024.

When a user attempts to attach a template to a project, they receive the following error: 

"Whoops! Something went wrong. Please contact Workfront so we can figure out what went wrong and fix it."

This occurs when the user does not have View permission to a custom form attached to the template.

**Workaround**

Use the "Customize and Attach" option to attach the template to the project.
