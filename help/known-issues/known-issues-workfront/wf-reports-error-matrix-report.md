When a user views a matrix report, they see the following error:

"[!UICONTROL Whoops! Something went wrong. Please contact Workfront so we can figure out what went wrong and fix it.]"

This has been reported when the report is sorted by date and the "[!UICONTROL Show weeks with no results]" option is enabled.

**Workaround**

Disable the "[!UICONTROL Show weeks with no results]" option.
