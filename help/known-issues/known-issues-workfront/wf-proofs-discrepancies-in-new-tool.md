# Proofs: Issues processing static files

<!--WF and WFP TOCs-->

Workfront recently changed its proof processing tool from a third-party provider to an internal solution, and has discovered some discrepancies in the capabilities of both systems. These discrepancies can cause issues with processing static files, especially PDF, Word, and PPT files. 

Workfront is working on upgrading its libraries to match the legacy tool, and will inform you about the changes on the Workfront release pages.

**Workaround**

For now, if you experience any issues with processing such files, we recommend you export the pages to JPG or PNG and proof them as such.
