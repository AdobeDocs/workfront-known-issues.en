# Proofs: Cannot adjust proof markups

<!--WF and WFP TOCs-->

When a user is making a comment in the proofing viewer and makes a markup on the proof, then clicks away, the user can no longer adjust the markup. 

**Workaround**

Try one of the following:

* Post the comment, then edit it. Editing the comment makes brings focus to the markup and allows it to be adjusted.
* Make another mark connected to the same comment, then delete the second mark. This brings focus back to the first markup.
