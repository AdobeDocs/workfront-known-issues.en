# Custom forms: External lookup fields do not return results

When an external lookup field references a multi-select field that has only one value selected, the field does not return the value. 

For example, if an external lookup field references a multi-select field that has both "red" and "blue" values selected, the field functions as expected. If the field has only "red" selected, the external lookup field returns no value.
