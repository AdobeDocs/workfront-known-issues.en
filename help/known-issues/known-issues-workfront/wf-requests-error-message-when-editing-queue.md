# Requests: "Whoops" message when editing request queue

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was fixed on November 10, 2022.

When a user is editing a request queue and attempts to save changes, they see the following error:

"Let's try that again. Whoops! Something went wrong. Please contact Workfront so we can figure out what went wrong and fix it."

In addition, the user sees the following message at the bottom of the page, near the Save button:

"Unable to access request queue email service. Please contact Workfront."

The changes to the request queue are saved despite the error message.
