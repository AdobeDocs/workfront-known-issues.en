# [!UICONTROL Boards]: Issues with [!UICONTROL Status change] functionality for linked items in [!UICONTROL Boards] cards

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on August 1, 2022.

The following issues have been reported regarding the [!UICONTROL Status change] functionality when moving a card between columns on [!UICONTROL Boards]:

* When viewing a card on [!UICONTROL Boards], the [!DNL Workfront] work item linked to the card displays a status. When the work item is opened in [!DNL Workfront], the displayed status is not the same as the status displayed on the card.
* When a card is moved from one column to another, the status of an item linked to that card does not change to reflect the [!UICONTROL Status change] settings for the columns.
* When a card is moved from one column to another, and then the card is opened the [!UICONTROL Saving updates] indicator at the top of the card continues spinning indefinitely. If a user attempts to change the status while this spinner is active, the status change dropdown options are unresponsive.
