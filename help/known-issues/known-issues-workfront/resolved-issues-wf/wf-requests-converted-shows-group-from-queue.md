# Requests: Request converted to project with template shows group from request queue, not group from template

When a user converts a request to a project using a template, the newly created project is associated with the group that owns the request queue, not the group that is assigned on the template. This occurs even though when the project is being created, the group associated with the template is populated in the Group field.
