When a user attempts to change the [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date] in the header of a task or issue, the date does not change and the user sees an error similar to the following:

[!UICONTROL 500: (Date that user is attempting to change to)/attask/api-internal/(object type)/(object ID)]

**Workaround**

Change the [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date] in the [!UICONTROL Details] area of the task or issue.
