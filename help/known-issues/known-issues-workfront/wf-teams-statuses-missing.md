>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue has been closed because it is not an issue.

The following issues have been reported regarding statuses for the [!UICONTROL Done] button when editing or creating a team:

* Some statuses may be missing from the Done button area of the [!UICONTROL New team] window or the [!UICONTROL Team Settings] area of an existing team.
* If the user attempts to save the team, they may see the error "You must select at least one status in each category."

**Workaround**

Viewing the list of statuses in [!UICONTROL Setup] > [!UICONTROL Project Preferences] > [!UICONTROL Statuses] may temporarily resolve the issues.
