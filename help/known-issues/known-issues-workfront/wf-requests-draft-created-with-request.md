# Requests: Draft created along with request causes issues

When a user creates and submits a new request in the new requesting experience, a draft is also created. The draft shows only the first letter of the submitted request's name, and attempting to open it results in a "Failed to retrieve" error.

In addition, if the submitted request is then deleted, it appears to be deleted but remains visible in the Requests area of Workfront. If the user attempts to reopen the request, they see a message indicating that the request does not exist.

_First reported on January 6, 2025._
