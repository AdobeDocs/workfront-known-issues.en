# Boards: Cannot assign user on a board on a workstream

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on September 21, 2023.

When a user attempts to assign another user to a task from a board that is part of a workstream, and begins to type the user's name, the user does not appear on the drop-down list of available users. This occurs even when the user is active and a member of both the board and the workstream.

The user may also notice that deactivated users appear on the drop-down.
