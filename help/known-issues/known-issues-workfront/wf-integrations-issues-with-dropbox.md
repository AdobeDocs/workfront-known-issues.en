# Integrations: Issues with Dropbox integration

The following issues have been reported regarding the Dropbox integration:

* When a user attempts to search for a file in the Dropbox file selector, they see an authorization error message, and the file selector does not retrieve the file from Dropbox.
* When a user attempts to open a linked folder, the user sees an error stating that the files or folder no longer exist in Dropbox.

These issues are due to issues with Dropbox, not Workfront.
