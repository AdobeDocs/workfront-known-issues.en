# Boards: Documents uploaded to cards show incorrect timestamp

When a user uploads a document to a card, the timestamp is in GMT (UTC) instead of the user's time zone. Relative times such as "2 hours ago" are accurate, but when the card displays the actual time, it is inaccurate.

_First reported on January 30, 2024._
