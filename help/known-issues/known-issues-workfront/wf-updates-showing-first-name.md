# Updates: Issues with tagging in legacy commenting experience

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was fixed on January 25, 2024.

When a user is tagged in a comment in the legacy commenting experience, the following issues occur:

* Only the user's first name is present in the comment
* The user's name is not marked with an @ symbol
* The user's name is not blue
* The user's name is not a link to that user's profile

The user does receive an email notification regarding the tag, as expected.

_First reported on January 23, 2024._
