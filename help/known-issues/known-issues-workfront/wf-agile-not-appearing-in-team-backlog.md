# Agile: Tasks assigned through bulk editing do not appear on team's backlog

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on November 4, 2022.

When a user assigns tasks to a Scrum team by using bulk editing, those tasks do not appear on the team's backlog.

Kanban teams are not affected by this issue.

**Workaround**

Assign the tasks inline, individually.
