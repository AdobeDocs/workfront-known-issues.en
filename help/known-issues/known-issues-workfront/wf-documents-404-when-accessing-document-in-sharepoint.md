# Documents: 404 error when accessing document linked from [!DNL SharePoint]

<!--This issue is on the WF and WFP TOCs. By request.-->

When a user attempts to access a document linked through [!DNL SharePoint], they are taken to a page with the following error:

"[!UICONTROL Error 404: Page not found. This page isn't available. Try checking the URL or visit a different page.]"

This is a known [!DNL SharePoint] issue that occurs when the site has an "@" symbol in the link.

**Workaround**

[!DNL SharePoint] recommends generating a short url, and using that for the link.
