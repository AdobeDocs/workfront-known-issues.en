<!--WF and WFP TOCs-->

When a user attempts to attach a document to a connected card, the user can select the document to attach, but the document does not appear in the document area of the card, and the document is not attached to the object that the card is connected to.

This has been reported in cards connected to issues.

**Workaround**

Open the object that the card is connected to, and attach the document directly in the object.
