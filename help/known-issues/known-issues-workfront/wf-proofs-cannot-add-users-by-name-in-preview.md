# Proofs: Cannot add users to a proof by name in the Preview environment

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue has been reported in the Preview Sandbox environment

When a user attempts to add another user to a proof, and searches for that user by name, the name does not appear, and the user cannot select it to add the other user to the proof.

**Workaround**

The Preview Sandbox environment refreshes over weekends. If the user was recently added to the Production environment, they will not appear in the Preview environment until after the next refresh. 

_First reported on May 1, 2025._
