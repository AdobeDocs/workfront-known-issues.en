# Proofs: Cannot add users to a proof by name in the Preview environment

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue has been reported in the Preview Sandbox environment

When a user attempts to add another user to a proof, and searches for that user by name, the name does not appear, and the user cannot select it to add the other user to the proof.

This may occur even after the Preview Sandbox environment has been refreshed.

_First reported on May 5, 2025._
