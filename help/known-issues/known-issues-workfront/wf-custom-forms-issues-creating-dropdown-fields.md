# Custom forms: Issues in custom dropdown fields

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was fixed on April 20, 2023.

Custom dropdown fields that are enabled as multi-select fields may display the following issues:

* The "+[!UICONTROL Add]" button is not present when the form is not in edit mode.
* Fields that do not have values show a "--[!UICONTROL no label]--" option.

**Workaround**

Try one of the following:

* Remove the option for the field to be multi-select.
* Set a default value.
