# Boards: "[!UICONTROL You have no access]" when viewing comments on a card
<!--

>This issue was fixed on January 12, 2024.-->

When a user attempts to view comments on a card that is not connected to a [!DNL Workfront] object, they see the following message: 

"[!UICONTROL You have no access to view comments on this object]"

This may occur even when the user could previously see comments on the card.
