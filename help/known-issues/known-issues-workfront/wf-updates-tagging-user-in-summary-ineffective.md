# Updates: Tagging a user with @ in Summary panel is ineffective

When a user attempts to tag another user by using @ in the Updates area of a Summary panel, clicking on the user's name in the dropdown is ineffective. Attempting to tag the user a second time works as expected.

**Workaround**

Tag the user again. The second attempt works as expected.

Or

Select the user using the Enter/Return key.
