# Proofs: "[!UICONTROL Disable proof email notifications]" setting displays inaccurately

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on August 17, 2023.

When a user is viewing proof settings in [!DNL Workfront], the "[!UICONTROL Disable proof email notifications]" checkbox does not accurately display the correct current setting. When the box is checked, indicating that proof email notifications are disabled, the notifications are actually enabled. The opposite is also true.

If the user views the "[!UICONTROL Disable proof email notifications]" setting in the [!UICONTROL Proof Defaults] area of [!UICONTROL Workfront Proof], the displayed setting is accurate.
