# Layout templates: Custom data fields not displaying when added to Task Summary through Layout Template

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue has been closed because it is working as designed. See the workaround below.

When an administrator adds a custom data field to the Task Summary section through a Layout Template, the field displays as empty for users looking at a Task's Summary section.

**Workaround**

Avoid using periods "." in custom field names to avoid this issue. You can relabel the custom field in the Summary section and include a period if desired.
