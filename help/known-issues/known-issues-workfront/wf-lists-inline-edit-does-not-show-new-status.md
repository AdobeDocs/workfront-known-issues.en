# Lists: New status not displayed when inline editing status

When a user inline edits the status of an object in a list, the new status displays for a moment, then reverts to the old status. If the list has a filter, and the filter does not apply to the new status, the object continues to display on the list even though it should not. 

If the user reloads the page they can see that the new status has been saved. 

**Workaround**

Reload the page.
