When a user creates a proof from a document, the proof is created. However, if a user creates another version of the proof, both the old and new versions are deleted. There is a [!UICONTROL Create Proof] option on the original document, and the proof versions can be found in the [!UICONTROL Trash] area of the [!UICONTROL Proofing] area in [!DNL Workfront].
