>This issue was fixed on January 30, 2025.

When a user attempts to move a card to another column, the card does not move, and the user sees the following message:

"Unable to find card in DB"

**Workaround**

Ensure that the user trying to move cards in a board is added to the board, even if they are an administrator.
