# Boards: Issues when viewing subtask status

The following issues have been reported regarding viewing subtask status on a card in Boards:

* The status is shown as "Select status" even when the task already has a status. This status can be seen when viewing the task directly.
* If the user attempts to select a status, the screen goes blank and must be refreshed.

**Workaround**

Go to the task to view the status.
