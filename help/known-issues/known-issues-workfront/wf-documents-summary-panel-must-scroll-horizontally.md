When a user views the [!UICONTROL Summary] panel for a document, the contents are too wide to be seen in the panel. The panel now has a horizontal scrollbar, and the user must scroll horizontally to see the [!UICONTROL Summary] panel contents. This occurs because the filename of the document does not wrap. This issue is limited to file where the filename has an HTML file extension.
