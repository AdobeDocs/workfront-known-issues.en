# Integrations: Slack notifications from Workfront are not triggering

When an event occurs in Workfront that should trigger a Slack notification, the notification is not sent. 

This has been reported for the following events:

* A user comments on a task or project assigned to the affected user
* The affected user is mentioned or tagged in a comment in Workfront.

This may occur even though the user's notification preferences are configured to send the notification in Slack.

_First reported on February 2, 2026._
