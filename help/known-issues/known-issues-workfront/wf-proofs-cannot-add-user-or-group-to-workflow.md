When a user is creating a new proof and attempts to add a user or group to a workflow, the dropdown does not populate with the user or group's name when the user is typing. Therefore, the user cannot select the user or group, and cannot add them to the workflow. It may occur that some names are missing from the dropdown while others are present.
