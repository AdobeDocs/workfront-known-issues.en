When a user attempts to view a document or proof by clicking the thumbnail in the [!UICONTROL Home Work List], they are directed to a blank page. This is because an invisible URL is just below the thumbnail image, and if the user clicks this URL it takes them to a blank page.

**Workaround**

Click directly on the thumbnail image.
