# Log in as: Home and pins display inaccurately when logging out of "Log in as"

When a user who is logged in as another user logs out as that user, they see the following:

* The Home page displays the name of the user they were logged in as
* Their pins are absent

These users only affect the display. The user has in fact logged out as the other user.

**Workaround**

Refresh the page.
