# Home: Approval stuck on [!UICONTROL Awaiting my approval] widget

<!--on WF and WFP TOCs-->

When a new version of a document is uploaded and the previous version has an approval that is not complete, the old version of the document becomes stuck on the approver's [!UICONTROL Awaiting my approval] widget. The approval cannot be approved since there is a new version, and it cannot be removed from the widget.
