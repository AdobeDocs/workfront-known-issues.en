# Reports: Report does not sort correctly when sorting by custom field

When a user runs a task report, the report appears to sort correctly when it is loading, but when it finishes loading the user sees that the report is not sorted correctly. 

This seems to occur if all the following circumstances are met:

* The report is a task report
* The report is sorted by a custom field
* The report has a grouping applied
