>This issue was fixed on October 13, 2022.

When a user attempts to log hours in the [!UICONTROL General Time] section of their timesheet, there are no boxes for them to enter hours into. If the user hovers over the area where they would enter hours, they see the message "[!UICONTROL Select a job title to log hours.]"

**Workaround**

To allow users to enter hours into [!UICONTROL General Time], a Workfront administrator can do the following:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Timesheets & Hours]** > **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**.
1. Uncheck the **[!UICONTROL Assign Job Roles to hour entries manually]** setting.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
