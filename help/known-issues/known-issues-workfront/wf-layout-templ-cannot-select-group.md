When a user who is a group administrator is attempting to create a layout template in the [!UICONTROL Interfaces] area of [!UICONTROL Setup], the user is prompted to select a group in the [!UICONTROL Administrative access] field. The user types in a group name, but the group does not appear in a dropdown and cannot be selected. Therefore, the user cannot save the layout template.
