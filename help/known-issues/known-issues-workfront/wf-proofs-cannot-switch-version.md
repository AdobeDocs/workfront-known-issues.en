When a user is viewing a proof in the [!UICONTROL Proofing Viewer], and switches to another version, the version dropdown becomes disables, and the user cannot switch back to the original version they were viewing, or to another version of the proof.

**Workaround:**

Try one of the following:

* Refresh the page.
* Select the Compare view, then close the version you don't want to view.
