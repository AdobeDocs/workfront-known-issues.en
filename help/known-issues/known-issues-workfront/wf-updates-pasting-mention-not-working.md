# Updates: Copying and pasting a mention does not notify the mentioned user

When a user copies a comment that includes a mention in @ format, then pastes that comment into the Updates area of another object, the mentioned user is not notified about the pasted comment.

**Workaround**

Manually tag the user, then paste the rest of the comment.
