# Proofs: Cannot generate proof

When a user attempts to generate a proof, the proof is not created, and the user sees the following error:

"[!UICONTROL Error generating proof]"

**Workaround**

Add the document that you want to create a proof from to [!DNL Workfront], then create the proof from the document in [!UICONTROL Workfront].
