# Custom forms: "[!UICONTROL Whoops]" error when setting up a calculated field

When a user is creating or editing a calculated field on a custom form, and includes a custom field in the calculated field's expression, the expression is considered invalid. The [!UICONTROL Save] button is disabled, and the user cannot navigate away from the custom field. In addition, the user sees the following message below the field:

"[!UICONTROL Whoops! Something went wrong. Please contact Workfront so we can figure out what went wrong and fix it.]"

Removing the custom field from the expression allows the user to save and navigate away from the field.
