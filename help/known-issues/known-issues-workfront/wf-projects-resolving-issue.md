# Projects / Issues: Project does not correctly resolve issue

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on August 3, 2023.

When a user changes the status of a project that is the resolving object for an issue, the issue status is changed to a status that does not match the same key as the status on the project.

**Workaround**

Remove the resolving relationship and set the statuses independently.
