# Filters: Cannot share a filter from a report on a dashboard

When a user is viewing a report on a dashboard and attempts to share a filter from that report, they are unable to share the filter. Clicking the three dots causes the dashboard to jump to the next report, and when the user scrolls back up to the intended report they see that the [!UICONTROL Share] option has not opened.

**Workaround**

Try one of the following:

* Open the report, then share the filter from inside the report.
* Navigate to a list of the object that the report represents, then share the filter from that list.
* Share the filter from the [!UICONTROL Setup] > [!UICONTROL Filters] area.
