title: 'Home: New Home widget preview does not display correct name of object'
description: When a user is configuring their Home page in the new Home experience, widget previews may not display the correct name of the object that the widget represents. This is because Workfront allows customization of object names. However, the preview images use the default name of the object. This means that if an organization has customized the name of an object, its preview will display a different object name than the organization uses.

# [!UICONTROL Home]: New [!UICONTROL Home] widget preview does not display correct name of object

When a user is configuring their [!UICONTROL Home] page in the new [!UICONTROL Home] experience, widget previews may not display the correct name of the object that the widget represents. This is because [!DNL Workfront] allows customization of object names. However, the preview images use the default name of the object. This means that if an organization has customized the name of an object, its preview will display a different object name than the organization uses.
