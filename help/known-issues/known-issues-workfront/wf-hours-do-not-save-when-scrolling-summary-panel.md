When a user attempts to enter hours for a task in that task's Summary panel, the hours do not save. This occurs when the user leaves the cursor in the square where they entered hours, and scrolls the [!UICONTROL Summary panel].

Click outside of the square where hours are entered before scrolling the [!UICONTROL Summary panel].
