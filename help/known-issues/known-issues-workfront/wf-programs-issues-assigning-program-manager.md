# Programs: Issues when assigning a [!UICONTROL Program Owner]

When a user creates a program and assigns a [!UICONTROL Program Owner], the following issues occur:

* The user sees the error "[!UICONTROL 500: Database error: BizContext.commit failed! /attask/api-internal/PRGM/(Program ID)]"
* When the user views the sharing for the program, they see that the new [!UICONTROL Program Owner] has been added, but any inherited permission that the program had have been removed.
