# Users: Issues with changes to Proof Profile 

The following issues have been reported in regards to making changes to a user's Proof Profile:

* When a user assigns a different Proof Profile to a user and saves, the change is not saved, and the user retains the previous Proof Profile.
* A user's Proof Profile may display as the incorrect Proof Profile, even if the correct Proof Profile is assigned.
* When other changes are made to a user, their Proof permissions may also change.
