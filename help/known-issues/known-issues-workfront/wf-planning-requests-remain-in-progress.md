# Workfront Planning: Request status displays as "In Progress" after request is approved

When a user views a completed request in the request list, the request status displayed is "In Progress" instead of "Complete."

If the user opens the request, they see that the request is in the status Complete. This issue affects only which status is displayed, not which status the request is in.
