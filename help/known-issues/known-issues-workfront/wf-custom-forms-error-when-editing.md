# Custom forms: Error when editing custom form through column

When a user is viewing a list of objects that includes links to custom forms, and attempts to edit a custom form by clicking on the link, the user cannot edit the form, and instead sees the following message:

"An error has occurred, and we are actively working to fix it."

**Workaround**

Open the object to which the custom form is attached, and edit the custom form through the Details page for that object.
