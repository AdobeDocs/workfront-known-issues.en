# Custom forms: Cannot scroll external lookup field

When a user attempts to view the options in an external lookup field, the options dropdown does not scroll, and the user cannot see the entire list of options

**Workaround**

Scroll the page so that the external lookup field is near the bottom of the screen. When the dropdown opens, it will appear above the field, and the user will be able to scroll.
