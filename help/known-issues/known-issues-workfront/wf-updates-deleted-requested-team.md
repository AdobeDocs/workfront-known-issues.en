# Updates: "[!UICONTROL Deleted]" displays as name of user in system updates when issue is converted to task

When a user who is logged in as another user converts an issue to a task, and the issue is assigned to a team, the system updates show "[!UICONTROL Deleted]" as the user who requested that the team work on the task.

**Workaround**

Viewing the updates as an admin displays the correct name.
