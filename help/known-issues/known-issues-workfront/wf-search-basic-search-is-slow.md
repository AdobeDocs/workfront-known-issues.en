When a user searches using basic search (the [!UICONTROL Search] icon), search results are returned extremely slowly.

**Workaround**

Use [!UICONTROL Advanced Search]. The link to [!UICONTROL Advanced Search] is at the bottom of the dropdown that appears when you click the [!UICONTROL Search] icon.
