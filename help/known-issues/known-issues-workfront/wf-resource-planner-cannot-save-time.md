# [!UICONTROL Resource Planner]: Cannot save after adding time

When a user in the [!UICONTROL Resource Planner] adds time and then attempts to save, the [!UICONTROL Save] button is unresponsive. If the user clicks [!UICONTROL Cancel], they see the following message:

"[!UICONTROL You have unsaved changes! If you navigate away from this page your changes will be lost. Do you wish to continue?]"

**Workaround**

Select the default filter. When the [!UICONTROL Confirm] message appears, click [!UICONTROL Save and Continue].
