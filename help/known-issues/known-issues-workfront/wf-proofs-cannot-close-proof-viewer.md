# Proofs: Cannot close proof viewer

When a user is viewing a proof in the proofing viewer and attempts to close the proof by clicking the X in the upper-right corner, the proof does not close.

This has been reported when accessing a proof through a link in an email.

**Workaround**

Try one of the following:

* Click the document name in the email to go to the document, then open the proof from there. This will allow the X to work as expected.
* Close the proof by closing the browser tab.
