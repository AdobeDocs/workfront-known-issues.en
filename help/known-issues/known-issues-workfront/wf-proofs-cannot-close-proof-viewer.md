# Proofs: Cannot close proof viewer

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on November 12, 2024.

When a user is viewing a proof in the proofing viewer and attempts to close the proof by clicking the X in the upper-right corner, the proof does not close.

**Workaround**

Try one of the following:

* Access the proof through the Documents list. This may allow the X to work as expected.
* Retry closing the proof.
* Close the proof by closing the browser tab.
