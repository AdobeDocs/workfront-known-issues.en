# Portfolios: User cannot set portfolio

>[!NOTE]

>This issue has been closed because it is working as designed.

Users cannot change portfolios on a project if they do not have access to the portfolio.

This has been reported in the following scenarios:

* If a user does not have access to an assigned portfolio on a project, that user is unable to change the portfolio as needed even if they have access to the portfolio they are trying to move the project to.
* When attempting to create a project using a project template, if the user who is creating the project does not have access to the portfolio or program on the template, the project will not be created with those assigned objects, and the project will show as independent (no portfolio or project assignment).

**Workaround**

Admins can give access or make adjustments as needed.
