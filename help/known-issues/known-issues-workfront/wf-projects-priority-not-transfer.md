# Projects: Project created from an issue using a template does not reflect priority set in template

When a user converts an issue to a project using a template, the priority in the newly created project does not match the priority set in the template.

This is working as designed. When converting  an issue to a project with or without a template, the priority of the issue transfers to the created project.
