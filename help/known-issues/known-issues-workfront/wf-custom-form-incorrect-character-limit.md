# Custom forms: Cannot edit custom forms due to incorrect character limit on Descriptive text fields

When a user attempts to edit a custom form, and that custom form has a Descriptive text field that currently contains more than 512 characters, the user cannot save the edits to the custom form, and sees the following error:

"The following fields are invalid: (Field) is too long, max 512"

This affects Descriptive text fields that have previously functioned well despite having more than 512 characters.
