# Documents: Summary panel is blank

When a user is viewing a Documents list and clicks on a document, the Summary panel opens, but remains blank. The user is unable to close the Summary panel.

If the user reloads the page, the Summary panel may populate as expected. However, if the user clicks on a different document, that document's summary panel is blank.

**Workaround**

To temporarily view the Summary panel, try reloading the page.
