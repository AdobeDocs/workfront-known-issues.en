# [!DNL Workfront]: Branding is not applied

When a user uploads files to the [!UICONTROL Branding] area of setup, the files appear to upload correctly. However, if a user views the [!UICONTROL Main Menu], they do not see the logo. Instead, they see the following message:

"[!UICONTROL Company logo unavailable. We could not load your company logo based on the provided URL. Please contact your system administrator.]"
