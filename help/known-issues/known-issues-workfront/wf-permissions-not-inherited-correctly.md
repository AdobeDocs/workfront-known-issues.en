# Permissions: Object permissions are not inherited correctly

Inherited permissions are not correctly being applied to objects. This may occur because of the complexity of the inherited permissions, which can be affected by the following:

* The object is shared with a large number of people
* A large number of objects are affected by an inherited permission change

**Workaround**

Limiting the size or complexity of the objects can help avoid this issue. We recommend that you have no more than 10,000 child objects under any parent object.
