# Permissions: Object permissions are not inherited correctly

>[!NOTE]

>The Product team is currently evaluating this issue resolution, which might require product enhancements. Product enhancements are communicated in the Product Announcements and not with the Maintenance Updates.

Inherited permissions are not correctly being applied to objects. This may occur because of the complexity of the inherited permissions, which can be affected by the following:

* The object is shared with a large number of people
* A large number of objects are affected by an inherited permission change

**Workaround**

Limiting the size or complexity of the objects can help avoid this issue. We recommend grouping data in smaller aggregate pieces.
