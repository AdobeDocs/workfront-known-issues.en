# Proofs: Cannot open proof from direct link

When a user attempts to open a proof from a direct link, the proof does not open. This may occur even though the user is on a workflow for the proof, or the user is a Workfront administrator.

**Workaround**

Go to the proof in Workfront, and select the "Open Proof" option.
