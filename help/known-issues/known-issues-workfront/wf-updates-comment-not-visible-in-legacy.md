# Updates: Comments made in new commenting experience are not visible in legacy experience

When a user makes a comment in the new commenting experience, and that comment appears in the Comments area of the new experience, the same comment may not appear in the legacy commenting experience. This may cause users using the legacy experience to miss comments.
