# Updates: Cannot view or download images in comments

When a user attempts to view or download an image from a comment in Workfront, they see the following error:

`Access to <domain>.my.workfront.com was denied`

* In the legacy commenting experience, the user can neither view nor download the image.
* In the new commenting experience, the user can view the image, but cannot download it.
