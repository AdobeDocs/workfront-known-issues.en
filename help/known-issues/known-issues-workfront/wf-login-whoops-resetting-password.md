# Login: Error displays when resetting password although action was successful

When a user is resetting their password, the Reset Password email is sent, but the user sees the following error:

"[!UICONTROL Whoops! Something went wrong. Please contact [!DNL Workfront] so we can figure out what went wrong and fix it.]"

Because the Reset Password has been sent as expected, The appearance of the error message may cause confusion.
