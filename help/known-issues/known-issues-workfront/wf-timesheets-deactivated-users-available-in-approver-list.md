# Timesheets: Deactivated users available when selecting timesheet approver

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on December 15, 2022.

When a user is creating a timesheet and attempts to assign an approver, the drop-down list includes deactivated users. If a deactivated user is selected, the timesheet is not saved and the user sees the following message:

"[!UICONTROL Error. Sorry! Only users with Plan license can approve or reject timesheets. Please contact your system administrator.]"

Since the deactivated user cannot be assigned, the user must select an activated user. The timesheet therefore functions as expected, but the deactivated users in the list may cause confusion or inconvenience to the user.
