# Updates: Team name not appearing in @mention

<!--Valid issue, won't fix-->

When a user in the new [!DNL Adobe Workfront] experience attempts to tag a team in an update and the team name is multiple words (for example, "Team Name"), they are not notified and do not appear in the To field. If the team name is entered in the [!UICONTROL Notify] field, they are notified as expected, but only part of the name is hyperlinked in the update.
