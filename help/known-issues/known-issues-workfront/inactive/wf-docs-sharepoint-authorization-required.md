# Documents: Cannot access [!DNL SharePoint]

<!--WF and WFP, article live for workaround-->

>[!NOTE]

>This issue has been closed because it is not a Workfront issue.

When a user attempts to open a [!UICONTROL SharePoint] folder in [!DNL Workfront], the folder does not open, and they see the following message:

[!UICONTROL Error: Authorization is required.]

Authorization timing is controlled by Microsoft.

**Workaround**

Reauthorize.
