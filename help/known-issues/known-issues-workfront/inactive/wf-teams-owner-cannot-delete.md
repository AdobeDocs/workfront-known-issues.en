# Teams: Cannot view team owner or delete team

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Product team is currently evaluating this issue resolution, which might require product enhancements. Product enhancements are communicated in the Product Announcements and not with the Maintenance Updates.

The following actions are unavailable to Group Administrators

* View or edit the team owner: The Owner field is not visible and cannot be edited.
* Delete the team: Attempting to delete the team results in the error "You do not have sufficient access to delete this team."

This occurs even though the group administrator has all permissions related to teams and users.
