# Approvals: Approval delegation is set for the incorrect number of days

When a user schedules personal time off and delegates their approvals for that time, the approval delegation may include days before or after the scheduled time off.

**Workaround**

This discrepancy results from a difference between the timezone in a user's profile and the timezone of the user's assigned schedule.

We recommend creating a unique schedule for each timezone that users work from, and assigning each user to the schedule that matches the timezone in their user profile.
