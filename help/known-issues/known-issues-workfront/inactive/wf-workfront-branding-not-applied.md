>Branding is not available if your organization has been migrated to the Adobe Admin Console, Adobe Unified Shell, or Adobe IMS (Identity Management System).

Branding is not available to organizations that have been migrated to the Adobe Admin Console, Adobe Unified Shell, or Adobe IMS (Identity Management System). When attempting to use branding, a user in one of these organization may see one of the following:

* Branding is not available as a setting in Layout Templates.
* When a user uploads files to the [!UICONTROL Branding] area of setup, the files appear to upload correctly. However, if a user views the [!UICONTROL Main Menu], they do not see the logo. Instead, they see the following message:

   "[!UICONTROL Company logo unavailable. We could not load your company logo based on the provided URL. Please contact your system administrator.]"
