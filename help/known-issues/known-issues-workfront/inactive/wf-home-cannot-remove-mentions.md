# Home: Cannot remove Mentions widget

If a user in the new Home wants to remove the Mentions widget, they cannot remove it.

The Mentions widget is controlled through the Layout template, which is managed by a Workfront administrator. This is functioning as designed, but there is no indication to the user that they cannot remove the widget themself.
