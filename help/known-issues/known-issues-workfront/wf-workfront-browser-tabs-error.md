# Workfront: Browser tabs left open fail to load

>[!NOTE]

>The fix for this issue is being rolled out gradually. 

When a user has Workfront browser tabs left open long enough for Workfront to require another login, instead of prompting the user to login again the page displays an error: "500-001a: Failed to load page". 

**Workaround**

Closing the logged-out browser tab and opening Workfront again will correctly prompt you to log into Workfront.
