# Issues: Converting an issue to a project using a template displays an incorrect error message

When converting an issue to a project using a template and an error is encountered, the user is shown a page with the message "The Project no longer exists" instead of the correct error message that explains the cause of the failed conversion.

**Workaround**

Returning to the previous page and selecting the template again casues the appropriate error message to display, allowing the user to correct the error and retry the conversion.
