# Custom forms: "[!UICONTROL Invalid custom expression]" message when referencing "[!UICONTROL owner]" in a calculated field

>[!NOTE]

When a user is adding a calculated field to an issue-level custom form and attempts to add any reference to an "[!UICONTROL owner]" (such as `ownerID`), the field does not save, and the user sees the following message:

"[!UICONTROL This is an invalid customer expression, please try again.]"

This occurs even when the expression is valid.
