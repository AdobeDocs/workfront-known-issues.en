# Boards: Cannot edit tag color

When a user attempts to edit the color of an existing tag in the [!UICONTROL Tag manager], the user cannot select another color from the dropdown. When the user clicks a color, the click is ineffective.

This issue refers to assigning colors to tags in the [!UICONTROL Tag manager]. Existing tags, including their colors, can be assigned to cards as usual.
