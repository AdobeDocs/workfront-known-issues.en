# Integrations: Cannot add new version of a document from [!DNL Google Drive]

If a user is viewing a document list, and attempts to add a new version of a document from [!DNL Google Drive], they see the message:

`There was an error accessing your documents, You need to reauthorize Workfront for access your Google Drive files. Press the "Reauthorize Google Drive" button to continue.`

When the user clicks [!UICONTROL Reauthorize Google Drive] and then attempts to add the document version again, they see the same message. Reauthorizing is not effective.

**Workaround**

Open the document, and add the new version from the [!UICONTROL Document Details] page.
