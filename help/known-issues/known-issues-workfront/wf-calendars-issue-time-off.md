# Calendars: Issues with Time Off calendar

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Product team is currently evaluating this issue resolution, which might require product enhancements. Product enhancements are communicated in the Product Announcements and not with the Maintenance Updates.

The following issues are being reported regarding the Time Off calendar:

* Calendar shows inaccurate dates for the user's time off. The calendar may show too many or too few days off.
* Calendar shows days off as "Partial" even though the user has requested the full day off.

The user's own Time Off page is accurate. Editing time off does not correct the calendar.
