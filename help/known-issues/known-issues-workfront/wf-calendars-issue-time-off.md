# Calendars: Issues with Time Off calendar

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was fixed on June 6, 2023.

The following issues are being reported regarding the [!UICONTROL Time Off] calendar:

* Calendar shows inaccurate dates for the user's time off. The calendar may show too many or too few days off.
* Calendar shows days off as "[!UICONTROL Partial]" even though the user has requested the full day off.

The user's own [!UICONTROL Time Off] page is accurate. Editing time off does not correct the calendar.
