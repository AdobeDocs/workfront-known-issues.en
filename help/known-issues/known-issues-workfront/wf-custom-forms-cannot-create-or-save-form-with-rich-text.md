# Custom forms: Display type conversions error on custom forms

>[!NOTE]

Rich text fields are causing the following error to appear on custom forms:

"Error: Display Type conversions between Text to Rich Text are not allowed."

This can occur in the following conditions:

* The user begins to edit the forms but clicks Apply without making any changes.
* The user is creating a custom form.

In both cases, rich text fields are causing the issues.
