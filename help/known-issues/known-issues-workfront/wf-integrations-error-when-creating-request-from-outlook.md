# Integrations: Error when submitting request from [!DNL Outlook]

When a user attempts to submit a request with attachments from an [!DNL Outlook] email, one or more attachments do not upload, and the user sees the following error:

"[!UICONTROL The following error occurred: File with handle xxxx does not exist.]"

This occurs only when an assignment is made for the new request, either through the request queue or manually when creating the request.
