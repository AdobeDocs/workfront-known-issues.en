# Proofs: Cannot tag users in proof comments

When a user attempts to tag another user in a proof comment and begins typing the user's name, the user does not appear in the list, and cannot be selected to be tagged.

**Workaround**

Be sure to capitalize the first letter of the user's name when typing it in. This will allow the user to appear in the list, and you can then select the user.
