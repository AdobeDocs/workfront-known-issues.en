# Notifications: Marking notifications as seen does not persist

>This issue was fixed on January 25, 2024.

When a user marks their notifications as seen and then navigates to a different page within [!DNL Workfront], the notifications icon still shows the number of unread notifications that existed before the user marked them as seen, and the notifications still list when the user clicks the icon. This continues if the user marks them as seen and navigates to another page or back to the original page.

**Workaround**

Refreshing the browser allows the notifications to function as expected.
