# Timesheets: Filter is not applied when page is refreshed

When a user is viewing a list of timesheets using a filter, and either refreshes or navigates away from the page and back, the filter is not applied. The filter appears to be selected in the filter list.

This occurs with filters under the "System Defaults" category. Saved filters are applied as expected.
