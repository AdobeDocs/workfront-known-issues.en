# New [!UICONTROL Home]: Widget filter and grouping defaults do not follow layout template

When a user views the [!UICONTROL My Projects], [!UICONTROL My Tasks], or [!UICONTROL My Issues] widget in the new [!UICONTROL Home] experience, the default filter and grouping for that widget are not the default setting in the layout template assigned to that user.
