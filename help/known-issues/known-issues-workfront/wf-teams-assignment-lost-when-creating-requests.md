# Requests: Team assignment when creating request does not appear on new request

>[!NOTE]

> This issue was fixed on August 11, 2022.

When a user creates a request and assigns a team to the request, then submits the request, the team is not assigned to the request that is created. This affects only team assignment. User assignments function as expected.

**Workaround**

Create the request, then go into the request and assign the team.
