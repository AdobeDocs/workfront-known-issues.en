When a user is filling out a custom form and searches a dropdown list using Ctrl+F or Cmd+F, then attempts to jump to the next instance of that search, the dropdown list returns to the top of the list rather than jumping to the next instance of the search. This occurs when a dropdown is set to allow multiple selections.
