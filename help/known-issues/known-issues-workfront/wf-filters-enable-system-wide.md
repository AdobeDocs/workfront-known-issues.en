If a user shares a filter and enables the "[!UICONTROL View system-wide]" option, the filter is shared with every user in the system. However, if an admin then views this filter in [!UICONTROL Setup], they see that this filter displays "[!UICONTROL false]" in the "[!UICONTROL Visible System-Wide]" column. To make this filter a system default, the admin must enable the "[!UICONTROL Enable system-wide]" option in [!UICONTROL Setup]. This may cause some confusion due to the similarity of wording.

* [!UICONTROL Filter] > [!UICONTROL Share] > [!UICONTROL View system-wide] **shares** the filter wil all users in the system.
* [!UICONTROL Setup] > [!UICONTROL Filters] > [!UICONTROL Enable system-wide] makes the filter a **system default** filter.
