When a user creates a proof and then views that proof in a report such as a [!UICONTROL Document Version] or [!UICONTROL Proof Approval] report, they see that the [!UICONTROL Active Proof Stages] field is blank. This occurs when the proof is created after the document is uploaded, either as a [!UICONTROL Simple Proof] or an [!UICONTROL Advanced Proof] with a [!UICONTROL Basic Workflow].

**Workaround**

Do one of the following:

* When adding a new document, add it as a proof by selecting [!UICONTROL Add new] > [!UICONTROL Proof].
* When creating a proof from an existing document, create it as an [!UICONTROL Advanced Proof] with [!UICONTROL Automated Workflow].
