When a user selects the "[!UICONTROL Remove pin]" option on a pin, receives a message about the removal, and attempts to replace the pin by clicking "[!UICONTROL Undo]" in the message, the pin is not replaced in the top navigation, nor is it added to the list of pins under the [!UICONTROL More pins] list (the three-dot menu in the [!UICONTROL Pins] area).

If a user attempts to re-pin the page by going to the page and pinning it, the pin is not created, and the user cannot pin the page.
