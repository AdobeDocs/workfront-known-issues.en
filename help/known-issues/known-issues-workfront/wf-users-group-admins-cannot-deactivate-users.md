# Users: Group administrators cannot deactivate users

When a group administrator attempts to deactivate a user in their home group, the user is not deactivated, and the group administrator sees the message "You don't have sufficient access to perform that operation." 

**Workaround**

Uncheck the "Is active" setting for the user.
