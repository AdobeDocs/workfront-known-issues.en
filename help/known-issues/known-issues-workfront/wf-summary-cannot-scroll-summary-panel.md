When a user is viewing an object's [!UICONTROL Summary] panel and attempts to scroll, the panel does not scroll, and the user cannot view items further down the [!UICONTROL Summary] panel. If the user clicks one of the icons on the left of the [!UICONTROL Summary] panel to jump to that area, the entire page scrolls and becomes unresponsive. The user must refresh the page to return to the list of objects.
