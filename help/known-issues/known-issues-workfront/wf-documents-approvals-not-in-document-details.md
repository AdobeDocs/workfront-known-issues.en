# Documents: Document approvals not available from Document Details page

<!--This known issue is listed on both the Workfront page and Workfront Proof page-->

When a user attempts to approve a document from the document's Details page, the Approve, Approve with changes, and Reject buttons are not available, and the user cannot make a decision on the document.

**Workaround**

Click on the document in the Documents list of a work item. The Approve, Approve with changes, and Reject buttons are available in the Document Summary area.
