# Documents: Document approvals not available from [!UICONTROL Document Details] page

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was fixed on September 7, 2022.

When a user attempts to approve a document from the document's [!UICONTROL Details] page, the [!UICONTROL Approve], [!UICONTROL Approve with changes], and [!UICONTROL Reject] buttons are not available, and the user cannot make a decision on the document.

**Workaround**

Click on the document in the [!UICONTROL Documents] list of a work item. The [!UICONTROL Approve], [!UICONTROL Approve with changes], and [!UICONTROL Reject] buttons are available in the [!UICONTROL Document Summary] area.
