When a user attempts to approve a document from the document's Details page, the [!UICONTROL Approve], [!UICONTROL Approve with changes], and [!UICONTROL Reject] buttons are not available, and the user cannot make a decision on the document.

**Workaround**

Click on the document in the Documents list of a work item. The [!UICONTROL Approve], [!UICONTROL Approve with changes], and [!UICONTROL Reject] buttons are available in the [!UICONTROL Document Summary] area.
