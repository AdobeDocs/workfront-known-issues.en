# Projects: [!UICONTROL Home Group] custom statuses not available when creating a project from a template

When a user creates a project from a template, and the template has no group associated with it, the custom statuses associated with the user's [!UICONTROL Home Group] are not available in the [!UICONTROL Status] dropdown of the "[!UICONTROL Create project]" interface.

**Workaround**

Save the project, then edit the status. The [!UICONTROL Home Group] custom statuses are visible after the project is saved.
