# Templates: Cannot select template from [!UICONTROL Favorite templates]

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was fixed on May 4, 2023.

When a user attempts to select a template from the Actions (three dot) menu, the list of templates disappears when the user moves their mouse to the list, and the user cannot select a template. This is because the scrollbar is between the menu and the list of templates, and the mouse focuses on the scrollbar as it moves to the list of templates.

**Workaround**

Try one of the following:

* Move the mouse to the list of favorites without touching the scrollbar.
* Select the template from the "[!UICONTROL Convert to project from template]" option.
