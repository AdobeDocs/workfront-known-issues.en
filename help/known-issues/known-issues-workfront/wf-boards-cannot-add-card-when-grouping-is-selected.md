# [!UICONTROL Boards]: Cannot add cards when grouping is applied

When a user is viewing a board that has a grouping applies, and attempts to add a card, the user can only enter the name of the card. The rest of the card fields are disabled, including the [!UICONTROL Save] button.

If the user changes the grouping to [!UICONTROL None], the issue remains. The user must change the grouping to [!UICONTROL None] and then refresh the page to restore the ability to add a card.

**Workaround**

Change the grouping to [!UICONTROL None], then refresh the page.
