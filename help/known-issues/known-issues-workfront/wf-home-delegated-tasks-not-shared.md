# Home: Delegated tasks are not shared and do not appear in Home Work List

When a user delegates a task to another user from the Home Work list, that task is not shared with the delegated user, and the task does not appear in the delegated user's Home Work List. This occurs when the delegated user does not already have access to the delegated task.
