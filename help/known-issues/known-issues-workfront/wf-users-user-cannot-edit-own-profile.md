# Users: User cannot edit their own user setting

>This issue was fixed on January 26, 2023.

When a user with a license of [!UICONTROL Work], [!UICONTROL Review], or [!UICONTROL Request] attempts to edit their own user settings, the popup that opens is blank, and the user cannot make any edits. To exit the popup, the user must refresh the page.

**Workaround**

A user with a [!UICONTROL Plan] license can make the change for the user.
