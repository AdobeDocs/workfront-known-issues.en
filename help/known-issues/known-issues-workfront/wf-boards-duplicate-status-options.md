# Boards: Duplicate status options for tasks and issues

>This issue was fixed on October 17, 2024.

When updating the status of a task or issue on a board, a duplicate option appears for certain statuses. The duplicate statuses, specifically Open and Ready, include a parenthetical reference to an unrelated group: for example, Open and Open (Group: Unrelated Group) appear in the list of available statuses. The non-duplicate status can still be selected without issue.
