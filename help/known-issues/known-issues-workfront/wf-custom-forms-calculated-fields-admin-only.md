# Custom forms: Calculated fields not displaying data for non-admins

When a user who is not a Workfront administrator views a custom form with fields that pull from data in an admin-only section of the form, that field does not display the calculated value. If the user runs Recalculate Expressions, the value displays but is lost on refresh.

Workfront administrators can see the field values as expected.
Workaround goes here
