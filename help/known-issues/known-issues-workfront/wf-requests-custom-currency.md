# Requests: Incorrect custom currency displayed on New request page

When a user is submitting a request and makes a selection that changes display logic on the request form, the currency displayed reverts to the default currency rather than the custom currency that is set on the project that the request queue represents.

When the user submits their request, the currency displays as the correct custom currency for the project that the request queue represents.
