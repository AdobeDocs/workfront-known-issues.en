# Workfront: Multiple browser tabs cause Workfront to log out

<!--Valid issue, won't fix. will be fixed by -->

When a user has multiple browser tabs open, Workfront may automatically log out.

This has been reported when using the Chrome browser.

**Workaround:**

* If you have an active Workfront tab open, reload the expired tab. It will return to the page you had open before it expired.
* If you do not have an active Workfront tab open, log into Workfront again.
