# Home: Deleted custom fields persist in project, task, and issue widgets

After adding a custom field to a project, task, or issue widget (such as My Projects) in Home, the custom field will continue to display without values even after it has been deleted.

**Workaround**

The custom field can be removed by accessing the widget's settings and removing the field from the widget, after which it will no longer appear as an option to add to the widget.
