>This article was fixed on August 18, 2022.

When a user is viewing a list of tasks in a report and opens the [!UICONTROL More] (three-dot) menu, the "[!UICONTROL Add to Iteration]" and "[!UICONTROL Add to Kanban Board]" options are not available in the dropdown. If the report is viewed in a dashboard, the "[!UICONTROL Add to Iteration]" and "[!UICONTROL Add to Kanban Board]" options are available in the dropdown.

**Workaround**

You can move the task to an iteration from a dashboard or from the project's task list.
