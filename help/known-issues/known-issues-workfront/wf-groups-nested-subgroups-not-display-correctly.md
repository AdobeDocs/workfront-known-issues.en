When a user is viewing the Groups list in the Setup area, they see that subgroups are not listed correctly under the parent group. The subgroup is correctly saved under the parent group, but the list may cause confusion.

If the user opens the subgroup, they can see in the breadcrumbs that the subgroup is saved correctly under the parent group.
