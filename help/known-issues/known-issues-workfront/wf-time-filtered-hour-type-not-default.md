# Time: Filtered hour type is not the default when logging time

>[!NOTE]

>This issue was fixed on July 9, 2024.

When a user is logging time, the preselected hour type is "[!UICONTROL Task time]" instead of the filtered hour type for that project.

The user can select the correct hour type from the hour type dropdown, but this is an extra step.

This has been reported in the following areas:

* Logging time through the Updates area
* Logging time through a widget on Home

**Workaround**

The user can select the correct hour type from the hour type dropdown.
