# Assignments: Time off icon does not appear when assigning tasks

when a user is assigning a task and begins typing the name of the assignee who has time off scheduled during the task, the user icons under the Suggested Assignments area do not display the time off (airplane) icon. If the user continues typing so that the name displays under the Users and Teams area, the icon does display.

**Workaround**

Continue typing the name until it appears in the Users and Teams area.
