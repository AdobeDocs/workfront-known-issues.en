# Reports: Report usage information is not updating

When a user views a report, Last Viewed information such as the Last Viewed Date and Last Viewed By are not updating. This means that any usage information may be incorrect.

This behavior has been reported when the user accesses the report in the following ways:
 
* Search
* Pins
* Favorites
* Recents

Accessing reports via a dashboard does update Last Viewed information.
