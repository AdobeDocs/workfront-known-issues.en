# Updates: Document comments do not appear in updates of parent object

<!--WF, WFP-->

When a user makes a comment on a document, that comment does not immediately appear in the Updates area of the document's parent object.

This issue has been reported in the new Commenting experience. Comments appear in the legacy commenting experience as expected.

_First reported on March 6, 2024._
