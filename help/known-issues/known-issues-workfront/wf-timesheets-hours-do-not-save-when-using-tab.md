When a user is filling out a time sheet and navigating between cells with the [!UICONTROL Tab] key, the hours are not saved. The [!UICONTROL Auto-save] notification does not appear at the bottom of the screen, and if the user refreshes the page, they can see the the hours were not saved.

**Workaround**

Navigate between cells using the mouse or the arrow keys.
