# Projects: Error when removing the Project Owner from the header

When a user attempts to remove a Project Owner from the header of a project, the Project Owner is not removed, and the user sees the following error message:

`422: Invalid Parameter: ownerID value "null" /attask/api-internal/PROJ/<project ID>`

**Workaround**

Remove the Project Owner from the project's Details area.
