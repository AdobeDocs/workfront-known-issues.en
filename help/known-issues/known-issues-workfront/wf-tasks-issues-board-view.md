>This issue was fixed on December 7, 2023.

When a user is viewing the Board view of the Tasks or Issues area in a project and attempts to add a task or issue, the following may occur:

* The popup window switches back and forth between two different window styles
* The user cannot close the popup window

This has been reported to occur when a user selects an area from the left navigation of the popup window before entering any information.
