# Assignments: Error when bulk assigning a team

When a user is bulk editing tasks or issues and assigns a team after assigning an individual, the assignments do not save, and the user sees the following error: 

"Let's try that again - The following error occurred: teamAssignments must be either a list of objects or a list of IDs"

**Workaround**

Assign the team first, followed by the individuals.
