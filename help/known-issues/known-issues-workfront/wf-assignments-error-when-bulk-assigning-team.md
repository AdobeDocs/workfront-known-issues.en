>This issue was fixed on October 20, 2022.

When a user is bulk editing tasks or issues and assigns a team after assigning an individual, the assignments do not save, and the user sees the following error: 

"[!UICONTROL Let's try that again - The following error occurred: teamAssignments must be either a list of objects or a list of IDs]"

**Workaround**

Assign the team first, followed by the individuals.
