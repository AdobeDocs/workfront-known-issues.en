# Timesheets: Issues related to adding hours to projects in Complete or Dead status

The following issues have been reported regarding adding hours to projects that are in Complete or Dead status:

* Users are able to add hours to projects that are in a status that equates to Complete or Dead. This is possible even though those options are disabled in Timesheet Preferences.
* When a user attempts to save hours added to a project in Complete or Dead status, they see the message "Your system administrator does not allow time entry for projects." This message does not inform the reader that the error is due to the project's status, and the user may be confused about what caused the error.
