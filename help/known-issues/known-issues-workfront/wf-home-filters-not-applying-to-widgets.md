# [!UICONTROL Home]: Filters do not apply to widgets in the new [!UICONTROL Home] experience

When a user applies a filter to a widget in the new [!UICONTROL Home] experience, the widget shows items that should be excluded by the filter.

This has been reported in the Custom Sandbox environment. The same widgets in the Preview and Production environments filter as expected.

_First reported on August 14, 2023._
