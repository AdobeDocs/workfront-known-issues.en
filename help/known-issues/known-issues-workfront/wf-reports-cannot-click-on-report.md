# Reports: Cannot click on a report from Custom Fields area of Setup

When a user is viewing the Custom Forms > Fields area of setup, and the view includes the native Reports field, links to the reports are not working. The user should be able to click on the name of a report and be taken to the report, but clicking the name of the report is ineffective.
