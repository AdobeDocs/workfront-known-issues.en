# Requests: "You do not have sufficient access" error when copying requests

>[!NOTE]
>
>This issue was fixed on February 2, 2026.

When a user attempts to copy a request via the request page, the request is not copied, and the user sees the following error:

"You do not have sufficient access to edit this issue."

**Workaround**

Copy the request directly, not from the requests list.
