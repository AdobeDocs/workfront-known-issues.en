# Tasks: No error message when reordering task in [!UICONTROL Pending approval] status

When a user attempts to reorder a task in a task list, and the task is in [!UICONTROL Pending approval] status, the task appears to move in the task list. Upon refresh, the user sees that the item has not moved. The item cannot move because it is in [!UICONTROL Pending approval] status, but there is no message telling the user that the item cannot move, which may lead to confusion.
