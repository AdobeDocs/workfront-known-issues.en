# Issues: Time fields save incorrect time when bulk editing issues

When a user is bulk editing issues and selects a date and time for a date field and saves, the time that is saved to this field in the issue is not the time that the user selected. Instead, the time appears to be converted to UTC when the user saves.

This has been reported in both reports and lists.

_First reported on January 2, 2024._
