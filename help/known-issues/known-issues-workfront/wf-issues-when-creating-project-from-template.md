# Projects: Performance issues and error message when creating a project from a template

When a user creates a project from a template and saves the project, the project takes 3-5 times longer than usual to be created. In addition, the user sees the message "[!UICONTROL Failed to Fetch]", which suggests that the project has not been created, although the project has in fact been created.
