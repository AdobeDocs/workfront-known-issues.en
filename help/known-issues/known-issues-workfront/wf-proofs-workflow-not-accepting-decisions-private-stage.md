# Proofs: Cannot make decisions on private workflow stage

When an automated workflow stage is private, users are unable to make proof decisions from the Document Details > Proof Workflow Stage.

Proof decisions in the proofing viewer function as expected.

**Workaround**

Use the proofing viewer to make the decision.
