>The Product team is currently evaluating this issue resolution, which might require product enhancements. Product enhancements are communicated in the Product Announcements and not with the Maintenance Updates.

When a user in the new Adobe Workfront experience is viewing a proof in the right panel in Home, then they click Reply in proof on a comment, a text box displays where they can leave an update in the document Updates area instead of being directed to the Proofing Viewer as intended.

**Workaround**: Open the proof in a new tab, then click Reply in proof to open the Proof Viewer from the document's Updates area.
